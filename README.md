## Overview

Easily embed public Instagram posts with the `IGEmbed` component. No access token is required.

### The Problem 

You just want to embed a public post in React. 

You may have tried creating a Facebook/Meta App, then requested `Oembed Read` permissions in order to programmatically retrieve the embed HTML for public posts. This HTML contains the `blockquote` and `script` tag you need to embed the post.

You then likely realized that this is a huge hassle, and requires you to jump through several hoops setting up an app and getting verified. And even then (like me) you may still receive errors when trying to use the API to get the embed HTML.

### The Solution

This component skips the API call for HTML by rendering our own embed-compatible HTML as a React component, and calling the Instagram embed script's embed processor directly in an effect after the render completes.

The result: Easy embedding of public posts! üéâ

### Features include:

- **üì∑ Simple and easy Instagram post embedding.**
  - Just provide a URL, that's it!
- **üîì No access token needed!**
  - Uses Instagram's [embed script](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram/oembed/), which doesn't require an API token.
- **üí™ Resilient**
  - If embedding fails, it automatically retries using an exponential backoff.
- **üíÅ Customizable**
  - Supports all `div` props and provides additional options.

## Installation

```
npm i react-ig-embed
```

## Quick Start

Simply import and provide the URL to the public post you'd like to embed.

```jsx
import { IGEmbed } from "react-ig-embed";
```

```jsx
<IGEmbed url="https://www.instagram.com/p/CUbHfhpswxt/" />
```

## Props

All props for the React `div` element are supported.

In addition, the following props are supported:

| Prop Name                | Type                     | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`                    | `string`                 | **Required.** The Instagram URL for the post to embed.                                                                                                      |
| `backgroundUrl`          | `string` or `undefined`  | *Optional.* A URL to an image to show (blurred) while the post loads.                                                                                       |
| `igVersion`              | `string` or `undefined`  | *Optional.* The API version to use. Defaults to `"14"`.                                                                                                     |
| `linkText`               | `string` or `undefined`  | *Optional.* The link text to show while the post loads. Defaults to `"View this post on Instagram"`                                                         |
| `processDelay`           | `number` or `undefined`  | *Optional.* Delay between rendering the component and processing the embed, in milliseconds. Default `100`.                                                 |
| `retryDisabled`          | `boolean` or `undefined` | *Optional.* Set to `true` to disable exponential backoff retry timer. Default `false`.                                                                      |
| `scriptLoadDisabled`     | `boolean` or `undefined` | *Optional.* Set to `true` to disable loading the embed script, in which case you'll need to load it yourself elsewhere. Default `false` (script is loaded). |
| `linkTextDisabled`       | `boolean` or `undefined` | *Optional.* Set to `true` to disable rendering the link text and logo shown while the post loads. Default `false`.                                          |
| `backgroundBlurDisabled` | `boolean` or `undefined` | *Optional.* Set to `true` to disable blurring the background image (if provided) shown while the post loads. Default `false`.                               |
| `softFilterDisabled`     | `boolean` or `undefined` | *Optional.* Set to `true` to disable the soft white filter over the background image (if provided) shown while the post loads. Default `false`.             |

## Styling

Feel free to use props such as `className` and `style` to customize the component's appearance.

You can also target this component with CSS using the `instagram-media-container` class name, and the inner component with `instagram-media`.

The contents of this component are modified from a `blockquote` to an `iframe` once the embed completes (both have the `instagram-media` class name).

Note that Instagram restricts the dimensions of the embedded `iframe` to a min width of `326px` and a max width of `540px`.

By default, the style `{ overflow: 'hidden' }` is applied.

## Retry Timer

This component includes a timer function that will check if the embed has succeeded. If not, it will reattempt the embed.

The timer uses an exponential backoff, doubling the delay each time.

To determine if the embed has succeeded, the timer function checks to see if a div no longer exists in the DOM. This div has the class name `instagram-media-pre-embed` and a randomly generated `id` attribute (uuid string), which it uses to check for existence using `document.getElementById()`. This div will be replaced when the embed succeeds, so if the div still exists in the DOM, the embed likely failed and it will reattempt the embed.

You can disable this feature with the `retryDisabled` prop.

## How It Works

This component relies on the [Instagram embed script](https://www.instagram.com/embed.js), which is loaded once to `window` by the `IGEmbed` component using [React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet).

The `IGEmbed` component adapts the HTML provided by Instagram when selecting the "Embed" option on any public post. This HTML contains a `blockquote` element with the class name `instagram-media`, placeholders for the content, and a link to view the post on Instagram.

Once the component renders, an effect is called to process the embed.

The function `window.instgrm.Embeds.process()` is called (only if it exists), which is Instagram's embed processor. This will scan the DOM for elements with the `instagram-media` class name and perform the embed for you.

Be mindful that the embed happens in the DOM outside of the React ecosystem, so React has no idea the contents have changed.

Official documentation for the embed script [can be found here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram/oembed/), in the section titled "Embed JS".

| Prop Name       | Type                    | Description                                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`           | `string`                | **Required.** The Instagram URL for the post to embed.                                                      |
| `backgroundUrl` | `string` or `undefined` | *Optional.* A URL to an image to show (blurred) while the post loads.                                       |
| `igVersion`     | `string` or `undefined` | *Optional.* The API version to use. Defaults to `"14"`.                                                     |
| `linkText`      | `string` or `undefined` | *Optional.* The link text to show while the post loads. Defaults to `"View this post on Instagram"`         |
| `processDelay`  | `number` or `undefined` | *Optional.* Delay between rendering the component and processing the embed, in milliseconds. Default `100`. |

## How It Works

This component relies on the Instagram embed script, which is loaded once to `window` by the `IGEmbed` component using [React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet).

The `IGEmbed` component uses the embed HTML provided by Instagram when selecting "Embed" on any public posts. This HTML uses a `blockquote` element with the class name `instagram-media`.

Once the component renders, an effect is called to process the embed. 

The function `window.instgrm.Embeds.process()` is called (only if it exists), which is Instagram's embed processor. This will scan the DOM for elements with this class name and perform the embed for you.

Be mindful that the embed happens in the DOM outside of the React ecosystem.

## TypeScript
